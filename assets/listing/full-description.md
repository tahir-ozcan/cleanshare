CleanShare removes tracking clutter from links you browse, click, or copy. It also bypasses common redirectors (Google /url, Facebook l.php) and lets you copy the canonical URL with one click.

### Features
• Auto-clean on navigation and link clicks (Declarative Net Request rules)  
• Right-click → Copy clean link  
• Keyboard shortcut: copy page’s clean URL  
• Popup with Copy + Copy canonical  
• 100% local: no analytics, no remote requests

### Why
Most links are bloated with marketing junk that makes them hard to read, hard to share, and privacy-unfriendly. CleanShare keeps your links simple, stable, and human.
