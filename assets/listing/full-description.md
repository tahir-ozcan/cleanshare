CleanShare removes tracking clutter from links you browse, click, or copy. It also bypasses common redirectors and lets you copy the canonical URL with one click.

• Remove tracking params (utm_*, gclid, fbclid, etc.)
• Skip Google/Facebook redirect pages
• Right-click → Copy clean link
• Keyboard shortcut to copy page’s clean URL
• No analytics, no data collection, zero servers

Why CleanShare?
Most links are bloated with marketing junk that makes them hard to read, hard to share, and privacy-unfriendly. CleanShare keeps your links simple, stable, and human.
